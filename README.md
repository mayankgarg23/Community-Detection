# Community-Detection

• Developed an application to identify social circles or communities in an ego network (Facebook network) based on both the links and node attributes/features and diffuse the information.
• Implemented the Louvain algorithm for community detection and then comparing the time for diffusion of information within the network based on an arbitrary node, central node, and each community node.
